# Flashlight

A minimalist flashlight application for Android devices with hardware flashes.

## Why?

There are many flashlight applications on Google Play. So why would someone
write yet another? Put quite plainly:

  * My current phone, a Samsung Galaxy Core Prime, has a hardware flash
  * I tried multiple flashlight applications from the Play Store
  * Most of the applications were either overkill, or bundled with ads
  * I just wanted a simple app allowing me to use the flash as a light

Strictly speaking, I didn't need to publish the application to the Play store. I
published it for the following reasons:

  * Convenience: It makes it easy to install for this and future phones
  * Education: I wanted to learn the details of publishing to Google Play
